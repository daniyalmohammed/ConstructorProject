**CS246: Final Project By: Daniyal, Giovani, Helen**

**Introduction:**
For our CS246 final project we implemented a game called Constructor. Constructor is an alternate version of the game Settlers of Catan. The game has 4 builders (Blue, Red, Orange, Yellow) corresponding to each player. The gameplay takes place on a board consisting of tiles, vertices and edges. Builders can build roads on edges and residences on vertices based on the game rules. These vertices and edges are located at different tiles with five different types of resources attached (Brick, Energy, Glass, Heat, Wifi). Building a residence and upgrading it gives the builder building points. When a builder reaches 10 building points, the game is over and that builder wins the game! The players can then choose to restart the game and play again.
